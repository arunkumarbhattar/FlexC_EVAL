# This greatly depends on your bandwidth.

# 33k: dunno, tell us what you find to be the best
# 56-64k: dunno, tell us what you find to be the best
# Cable: dunno, tell us what you find to be the best
# DSL: dunno, tell us what you find to be the best

# The next option is a very nice thing. Just set it on ;)

# How long do we wait when there is no response before starting again

# exit

#The maxbps option can be used to limit the bandwith consumption of
# prozilla for example maxbps = 40000 will limit it to consume a maximum of
# 40k of bandwith, the default is 0 which means unlimited bandwith
# consumption (ie no limitation just get as fast as possible)
