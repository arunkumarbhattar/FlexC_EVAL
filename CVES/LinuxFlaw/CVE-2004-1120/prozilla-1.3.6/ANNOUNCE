	        ProZilla The Download Accelerator For Linux
                ===========================================

ProZilla is a download accelerator for Linux which supports both HTTP and
FTP protocols. ProZilla makes multiple connections to the server and
downloads the file in portions thus defeating existing Internet congestion
prevention methods which slow down the conventional single connection
based downloads, so providing you with the best possible download speed
your bandwidth supports. Improvements of 200% are easily achievable using
ProZilla. Resuming too is fully supported.
