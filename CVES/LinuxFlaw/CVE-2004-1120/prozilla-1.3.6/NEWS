Changes in the latest CVS version
---------------------------------
Fixed the bug where a http download where the sizwe was not known would not
work, it was a typo in the code :(
Replaced strtok with the recursive equivalents strtok_r.
________________________________________________________________________
Added the Referer Tag for HTTP.

Periodically (every 5 minutes) tries to loggin to the ftp server, to see
whether a user has disconnected and whether it can take advantage of it ;)

Now checks and warns about free diskspace before rebuilding the file. 

Changes in ver 1.3.3.2
------------------------
Added backup ftpsearch servers, so that if lycos changes its ftpsearch
location again, we have a backup ftpsearch server to fall back upon.

Changed Makefile.am and now additional targets were added, namely "dist",
and "rpm", which enable one to make a distribution tarball or a rpm easily.

Changes in ver 1.3.3.1
------------------------
Richards patch was applied which makes prozilla now read the proper
sysconfdir/prozilla.conf.

Michaels patch which corrected overscrolling in the ncurses interface was
applied.

Changes in ver 1.3.3
------------------------
Lycos changed their ftpsearch url from ftpsearch.lycos.com to another
location which broke prozillas ftpsearch ability, I have fixed that, and
also added a directive to the prozrc.sample file as,
#ftpsearchurl = http://download.lycos.com/swadv/AdvResults.asp  
which should enable anyone to change the location if lycos decides to try
the same stunt in the future without having to recompile prozilla.

The directory where the output files are stored can be specified via the
config file or with the command line switches -P or --directory-prefix

Bandwith throttling is now supported.

Fixed the .netrc being not utilised properly.

Cleaned up several ncurses specific napms functions and replaced them with
delay_ms function defined in misc.c, in order to plan for the library.

Cleaned up references to strdup and replaced the with nstrdup 

Applied Uwe's patches  which corrected spelling mistakes in the man pages
and the documentation. 

Michaels patch which simplified the code was added.

Updated the manpages with regard to the contributors.

Changes in ver 1.3.2
------------------------
Fixed a bug related to the download speed.
Man page was updated.
Replaced the gethostbyname with gethostbyname_r (reentrancy problems)
You can switch to different servers among the ftpsearch returned results,
while downloading if you are not satisfied with the results. 
The file rebuilding progress is now displayed as a percentage.
Added pthread cleanup handlers.
Added several more options to the config file.
Switch -s is a alias for --ftpsearch, thus simplyfying things up.
Modified the example config file prozrc.sample slightly and added other
options to it. 
Changed the README as to add more information about the new functionality.
Updated the FAQ with how to install the config file.
Ralph fixed a couple of errors.
Moved the functions which setup the runtime environment to init.c 

Changes in ver 1.3.1-pl1
-----------------------
Thanks to Flower prozilla is now able to support a config file, a example
of the config file is found as prozrc.sample.
Now the user can select any server from the ftpsearch results by pressing
enter, or if the pinging is taking too long he can abort with CTRL+A and
the fastest server found till then will be used, otherwise one the ping is
completed the fastest server will be used automatically , which is what
happens as default. 
Recorganised the ftpsearch.c file.
The man page proz.1 is symlinked now.



Changes in ver 1.3.1
-----------------------
Now ftpsearch is off by default, specify the --ftpsearch option to enable.
Flowers mutithreaded ping added, pings by default 3 (changable with the
--pao switch) servers at a time.
Added --pt, --pao, and --max-ftps-servers switches.
Display added to show the status of the pinging.
The ping code was improved and I fixed a bug in it too which led to
incorrect results.
Uwe's patches to 1.06 are included.
Now if a server does not support resume, and a user specifies the -r
switch, will warn the user and attempt the download from the start,
instead of exiting.

Changes in ver 1.3.0
-----------------------
Added ftpsearch support.
Added a --no-ftpsearch switch. 

Changes in ver 1.06
-----------------------
A FTP downloading problem with Older versions of Wu-FTP servers which got 
uncovered because of the recent use of the PASV command was fixed.
Added a --debug option for dumping debug info if necessary.
Now the counter displays in the format like "230K of 680 bytes received". 
The ftp code was improved to correctly handle badly behaced servers who
sometimes reject the connection attempt without a valid return code.
Redirections from a http server to a ftp server were not supported, now it
is supported. 
Increased the number of attempts at retrying if a error occurs to 200 from
20, and increaed the retry delay between attempts to 15.

Changes in ver 1.06pre1 
----------------------- 
Added HTTP basic authentication.
Now we use PASV by default for FTP transactions since using PORT caused
problems when run behind certain ip masq setups.
 A bug which occured when files less that 7 byets in size were downloaded
using the http protocol was fixed.
The screen drawing routine was changed so that the occasinal screen
corruption should not occur.
Corrected a problem where the debug.log appeared in the normal download.
THE HTTP and FTP single threaded downloads error recovery was improved. 
The --use-pasv was removed since PASV is used by default and the
--use-port option was added so that anyone can force the PORT command to
be used rather than the PASV.
A man page for prozilla was added to the distribution.


Changes in ver 1.06pre0
-----------------------
A very important condition which caused prozilla to prematurely end a
download due to problematic servers has been fixed. Now prozilla ignores
the servers end of data, if it does not agree with the number of bytes to
download. So it will reconnect and continue downloading from where it was
interrupted.

Changes in ver 1.05pl1
--------------------
I am now checking for exceptional conditions in connect.c to see whether
it helps to clear up the strange bug that is hapenning. Experimenting with
setting the TCP_NODELAY flag to see whether it improves the speed. Changed
the timeout to 180 seconds, on Rich's suggestion...


Changes in ver 1.05
--------------------
A bug in the http code related to whether a server supports resume or not
was found and fixed.
A bug with the relaunching of ftp cconections when a connection attempt 
was rejected due to a maximum number of allowed ip addreses was fixed.
The time interval between retries was changed to 25 seconds

 
Changes in ver 1.04e
--------------------
A bug where ProZilla still connected to port 21 when a url in the form of
ftp://server:234/pub/xxxx was specified, was fixed.

Changes in ver 1.04d 
-------------------- 
The handling of a situtation where a ftp server disallows more than a
certain number of connections per ip address has been improved. 

A new option --no-getch was added, where when a error occurs ProZilla will
print the error and quit right away rather than waiting for a keypress
from the user, which is the default behaviour.

Fixed a bug where a wrong error message was reported. 

Changes in ver 1.04c
-------------------_
When the connection times out during connecting a more detailed error
message is displayed. 

A bug with regard to retrying the thread when the login is denied by the
ftp server was fixed.

Changes in ver 1.04b
-------------------
Stability and recovery is improved a lot especially with error prone 
connections.

It now retrys any failed connections until it is succesful or until the
maximum number of trys (default 20) are reached, which is changeble.

Added commandline chagable options related to connections which are,
--timeout and --tries and --retry-delay.
A bug in the percent indicator which appeared for large files was fixed. 

Changes in ver 1.01
-------------------
The ftp-parse files were added which further improves and cleaned up
several bugs in the FTP code which were reported by Flower
<floweros@golia.ro>.

The user can specify the number of connections to make via the -k= switch.

If the number of connections are greater than those displayable, the user
can browse through them by using the UP and DOWN Arrow keys.

The HTTP code is more robust and supports other ports than the default http
port too.

The ProZilla FAQ was added.

More detailed error reports

Changes in ver 0.99.9.5
-----------------------
Added a more thorough output to ftp-retr.c message statement.

Added the use_pasv to the runtime structure which makes it easy to specify
whether to use PORT or PASV as the default method

Using PORT as default from now.

Changes in ver 0.99.9.4
-----------------------
Added the IPTOS_THROUGHPUT to further increase the speed of the downloads.

Fixed a problem with the incompatibilities between ncurses versions 4.x and
5.x.

Also included a header which was causing compilation problems.

Changes in ver 0.99.9
-----------------------
The download rate is at it's most accurate now..Dammit I am not good at
maths...:(

The FTP threads now support downloading even when a ftp server rejects the
initial connection...the F**s...

Support for the .netrc file added.

Organized the runtime options to a structure and made things more organized.

Added display of CTR-L 

Changes in ver 0.99.8.1
-----------------------
Now the size of a ftp file is figured out by the SIZE command  

Fixed a problem with the display when resuming.

Organized the code on to ftp-retr.c and http-retr.c 

Added support for printing the version

The download rate is computed more accurately now...

A bug when PASV is not supported by the ftp server is fixed

Changes in ver 0.99.8
---------------------
FTP now starts with PASV as the first choice and reverts back to using
PORT, if it PASV fails.

Changed a minor error with the assert statements.

Changed the appearance of the code.

Removed a unnecessary close statement.

Fixed a bug related to the accept_ranges header

CTRL-L now refreshes the ncurses screen...

Prozilla now checks for previously downloaded file portions and prompts
the user whether he would like to resume the previous download etc. It
does not do this check when started in resume mode as this would be
redundant.

Changes In ver 0.99.7
--------------------
Prozilla now prompts the user about overwriting files, thus if gnu.jpg is
requested and gnu.jpg also exits in the same directory, The user will be
prompted. This check can be disabled by using the --force or -f options,
then the files are overwritten without prompting the user. Thanks to Rich
<richdawe@bigfoot.com> for  suggesting it.

The GTK display now displays in Kb/sec thanks to Wilmer for the change.

Changes in ver 0.99.6
---------------------
Richard Dawe's gproz script and several spelling related diffs (also by
him) were included.


Changes in ver 0.99.4 from 0.99.3.2
-----------------------------------
When resuming, the bytes/sec value computed is now correct.

Modified the gtk display and the curses display to display the correct
value. 

Changes in ver 0.993.2 from 0.99.3
----------------------------------
The name of the executable is now prz 

The dax.c and dax.h were changed to main.c and main.h respectively.

Calls to the message function containing '/n' were converted to without
the newline because this tended to mess the gtk display.

Changes in ver 0.99.3 from 0.99.2
---------------------------------
Changed the socket options set in connect.c

The situation where a FTP server doesn't allow more than one or n
connections is detected and handled appropriately (the  **!! servers)

Curses display changed a bit..
