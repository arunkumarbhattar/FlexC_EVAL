1. Add internationalisation support (and get as many .po files as
possible)

2. Make X interface to work again w/ the new options implemented. If you
are good at GTK, QT, Tcl/Tk or whatever please help.

3. Modifiable number of threads while download is in progress.

4. Reutilisation of threads. If a thread finished the download it may
*help* other slower threads by getting a part of the remains.

5. Support for more ftpsearch sites, configurable by user.
filez.com, www.filesearch.ru, www.ftpsearch.de and many, many others
since users may have faster searchers near them.

6. Support for custom headers in HTTP (eventually cookies)

7. enable downloading files to a user specified directory
8. regexp  support

9. Flower :And also a TEMP_DIR? For those who dl large files but don;t
have enough space in one partition.

10. Uwe: IMHO prozilla should read the environment variables TMPDIR, TMP,
and TEMP. If none of those are defined it should use /tmp.

11.  replace calls to sprintf with snprintf
12. Remove DJB's parsing codes and replac with our own
13. Experiment about adding Lara Young's <lara_hack@gmx.co.uk> suggestions
about downloading to a single thread
