		ProZilla the Download Accelerator for Linux
                                  v1.3.6
                ============================================

Welcome, gentle reader.

ProZilla is a download accelerator for Linux which gives you a 200% to 300%
improvement in your file downloading speeds.
 
Features:
Supports FTP
Supports HTTP including redirection. 
Resume Supported.
Complete acceleration: The file will be downloaded as fast as possible as
your bandwidth allows. 
Unlike certain other download accelerators available for Linux this really
works.
FTP passwords can be specified with the URL, or can be obtained
automatically from the .netrc if it exists.
The number of connections that prozilla uses can be specified using the -k
option (4 by default).

*** New Features ***

*** FTPsearch support now permits fetching Mirror locations and pinging
them and selecting the fastest server is automatically done, to do this
specify the -s option.

*** The bandwidth can be limited using the --max-bps switch or from the
config file. For example when run with say --max-bps=20000 prozilla will
no exceed 20Kbps for the complete download. By default this is set to 0
which means no throttling, use unlimited bandwidth if necessary.

*** Configuration files (~/.prozrc or /etc/prozilla.conf) are supported
thanks to Flower, please see the sample prozrc.sample file for a example
on how to create a custom config file whose options would be used by
prozilla for each session.


1. Configuring
--------------
Please type,
./configure
from the ProZilla directory to configure the package.

Typing ./configure --help, will show you the various options that you can
use to change the configuration process.

For example if you have the gtk toolkit installed, but you don't wish for
gtk support to be compiled in, you can do so by specifying,
./configure --without-gtk

Please note that you have to have the pthread library and (n)curses
installed for you to compile the program. The gtk library is optional and
if found support for the gtk front end will also be added.

2. Make
-------
Once the configuration process is finished, please type
make
to start the compilation of the package.

3. Installing
-------------
If the make process was successful, then you can install it by typing
make install
which will install the binaries in the /usr/local/bin directory by default.
If you wish another directory, you can change this with the --prefix option
supplied to configure.

If you wish that the binaries be stripped too (reduces the size), please
type
make install-strip


4. Running
----------
Running:
The syntax will be,
proz <URL>
where URL is the file you wish to download.

For example,
proz  ftp://gnu.org/pub/README
will connect to to the server gnu.org and start the download of the file
README from the pub directory.

ProZilla by default uses 4 connections but you can change it with the -k=
option. If for example you want to try with 7 connections, you would type
'proz URL -k=7'.

***NOTE***:
FTPSearch support is now added but off by default, so to enable it, please
run with the -s switch, you can select from the list of servers displayed
too if you wish.

If you want ProZilla to use a different username or password for ftp sessions,
than the default anonymous login, you can specify it in the command line, or
if you have a .netrc file, it will automatically select the appropriate
username password combination for the particular host, otherwise it will use
the default anonymous login.

If you don't want it to use the .netrc password, you can force it to either
use a user/password supplied on the URL or else use the anonymous login, by
the "--no-netrc" or "-n" options,

By default ProZilla will prompt you before overwriting any files, however
it will not prompt you if run with the -f or --force options should you wish
to do so.

NOTE: As of ProZilla v1.06pre1, ProZilla now uses PASV as the default. If
you are uncomfortable with this, or encounter problems, you can force ProZilla
to use PORT using the --use-port option



A small note
------------
ProZilla was written by Kalum Somaratana (aka Grendel) <kalum@delrom.ro> For the complete list
of the people who were kind enough to contribute to ProZilla please read
the CREDITS file and the AUTHORS file.

It was written to fulfill the need of a good quality download accelerator
for Linux, which would allow users (especially the people with slow dialup
connections) to download files as fast as possible as their connection
would allow. 

For Windoze users there already existed a good download accelerator but
for Linux users unfortunately there wasn't much of a choice, and we hope
that ProZilla will improve that situation considerably.

Although we have taken great pains to test this application extensively,
there probably may be a few bugs :(, since this is the first major
release. However if you come across them we kindly request you to inform
us <prozilla@delrom.ro> and we will make sure that they will be removed
from the next release.

We sincerely hope that you will like the download accelerator..
Enjoy!
