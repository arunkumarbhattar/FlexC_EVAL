## problem in exploit

In file mcrypt.pl, variable `$saved_eip_off` is set as 0x71 to overwrie saved EIP, actually, it should be at least 0x74 (0x70 to reach saved ebp, 0x4 for saved ebp)

To compile in x64 architecture, you need to use clang rather than gcc as C compiler

To compile version mcrypt-2.5.8, you are supposed to modify a file
