Title:          mcrypt
Version:        2.3
Entered-date:   27May99
Description:    A replacement for the old unix crypt(1) command. Mcrypt 
                uses the following encryption (block) algorithms: BLOWFISH, 
                DES, TripleDES, 3-WAY, SAFER-SK64, SAFER-SK128, CAST-128, RC2
                TEA (extended), TWOFISH, RC6, IDEA and GOST. The unix crypt
                algorithm is also included, to allow compatibility with the
                crypt(1) command. 
                CBC, ECB, OFB and CFB modes of encryption are supported. 
Keywords:       crypt, blowfish, gost, des, 3des, 3-way, safer, tea, cast, encryption, twofish, rc2, rc6, idea
