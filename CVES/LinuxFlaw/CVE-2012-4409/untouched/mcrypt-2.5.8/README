Mcrypt is a simple crypting program, intended to be replacement for the old 
unix crypt(1). 

Look at COPYING for license information and the individual files for more 
information. COPYING applies only for the mcrypt program and not the 
algorithms which most of them are public domain.

The 2.5.x version of mcrypt can be compiled against libmcrypt 2.4.x 
(which is modular) or libmcrypt-nm. By using the 'nm' series of 
libmcrypt you may loose a some improvements which exist only in the modular
versions of libmcrypt.
