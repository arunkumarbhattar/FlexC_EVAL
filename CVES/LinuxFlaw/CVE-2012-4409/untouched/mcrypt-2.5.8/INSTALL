		INSTALLATION for mcrypt

To install in just write 'configure' and 'make' to compile the 
program (you need a c compiler like gcc). Then type 'make check' and if
the test is successful type 'make install' as root to copy  
the program in /usr/local/bin or in prefix, if specified. 
As far as I know it runs in both big-endian and little-endian machines.
It tried to make this program as much compatible with different systems as I 
could. If it does not work on your system or if the output is incompatible 
with other systems report it to nmav@hellug.gr and mention your system 
type (cpu), endianess and the size of long integer (32bit or 64bit).

If "make check" reported problems, you should turn off optimization
in your compiler. If the problems persist it is probably a bug in
mcrypt.

If compilation fails because of gettext (nls code), use the --disable-nls,
if you want to disable internationalization, or --with-included-gettext, if
you want to enable it, as a parameter to configure script. On IRIX 6.4
there is a problem with the nls code, so use --disable-nls.

If you're installing with nls support, follow the instructions in ABOUT-NLS
file. Briefly put in the environment parameter LINGUAS the
characters which identify your country's language according to iso639 
(eg. "el" for greek language).

If your system does not support fcntl style locking use the parameter
to configure --disable-fcntl-locking.
