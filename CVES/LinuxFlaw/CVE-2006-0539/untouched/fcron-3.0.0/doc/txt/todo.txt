1.5. Todo

   Here are some things that should be done ... Note that some of these
   entries are just some ideas, which may be done in the long run.

   If you see something you'd really like to see implemented here, feel
   free to send me a mail: it may make me move it to the top of my to-do
   list ;) .

   If you plan to help me, please send a mail at <fcron@free.fr> to
   prevent two people from doing the same thing. You can send me some
   propositions as well, or ask me to move something to the top of the
   heap ;) .

1.5.1. High priority

     * test the fix for empty mails on non linux systems (solaris seems
       ok, feedback on BSD ?)
     * bug fix : fcron freezes if the filesystem on which it operates has
       no space left ? (cannot reproduce it on my linux system)

1.5.2. Low priority

     * code cleaning : create a .c/.h file for data structures (file/line
       lists, serial queue, lavg list, exe list), and work with them only
       through functions/macros. + secure equivalent to
       str[n]{cat|copy|...}
       Note : may introduce bugs, so it will be done in fcron 3.1.x, and
       needs to be tested thoroughly..
     * Mem footprint reduction : use an/some union(s) in CL struct.
     * For environment settings, make a var substitution.
     * add a return code for jobs which would mean that they should not
       be run again (in case of an error, etc...).
     * Use directory notifications (FAM), and support a fcrontab and a
       cron.d as Vixie cron does (directly included in fcron itself, not
       thanks to a script as now).
     * PAM support (included in fcron, but needs more tests by people
       using PAM - not implemented in fcrondyn : is it needed in fcrondyn
       anyway ?)
     * support for per user serial queue (especially for root)
     * use readline (if available) for fcrondyn.
     * add a mailsubject option, for custom mail subjects (for instance,
       in case of a job containing something secret -- password, etc --
       in the command line).

1.5.3. Ideas

     * add a system of modules : at startup, fcron loads some modules
       (.so files). Then, when fcron should run the job, it calls a
       function of the module, and let it manage the job (threads ?). (do
       linux dlopen(), etc exist on other systems ? - yes : thanks
       Harring ;) dlopen exists on all POSIX system - even windoze -
       abait it does not use the same insterface of function calls. But
       it can be easily implemented to port to another system.).
     * (related to the system of modules ? create a kind of dependencies
       ?) Add a way to run a job only if a command returns true. It would
       permit, for instance, to run some jobs on a laptop only if it is
       on AC power.
       and depending on the return value of the command, cancel the
       execution, or wait x seconds before trying again, etc. In this
       case, needs change the way the jobs are queued ?
     * add an option/module to prevent fcron from running a job if the
       system is running on battery (anacron does it ?)
     * Add a way to stop a job (SIGSTOP) if the lavg gets to high, and
       restart it (SIGCONT) when the lavg has decreased.
     * Add a timeout for task completion : if a task takes more than a
       specified timeout, then start another script with the initial task
       PID as argument. That would allow a kill with different signals
       (-HUP, -TERM -STOP, .... or any other action like sending a mail
       to sysadmin to alert him/her that a task is taking too much time
       and that he has to have a look at it.) (add an option to specify
       the cmd, and combine w/ option until)
