    **You still input root password. Without right root password, you can't change as root.**

## demo_root.sh
    
    mdl@NjuMdl:~/Repos/Gitlab/LinuxFlaw/CVE-2015-1328/LD_PRELOAD/Demo3$ ./demo_root.sh 
    Password: 
    **You should first input root password. Because it needs to copy ld.so.preload to /etc ,then**
