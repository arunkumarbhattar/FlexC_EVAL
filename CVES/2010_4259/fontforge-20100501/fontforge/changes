Add two python methods:
  contour.similar
  layer.similar
which allow you to compare two contours (or layers) and specify an error bound on how far they may diverge.

revision 1.3358
date: 2010/04/27 14:33:20;  author: pfaedit;  state: Exp;  lines: +3 -3
The last patch fixed up the kerning subtable list when a font info dlg was dismissed. This patch fixes the feature list. A much less grave problem (no crashes) just user confusion.
----------------------------
revision 1.3357
date: 2010/04/26 21:26:05;  author: pfaedit;  state: Exp;  lines: +3 -3
Barry reports that the metrics view crashes for him because things in the pairwise kerning subtable pulldown list are sometimes garbage. Mmm. This can happen if the user has a metrics view open and then uses font info to delete a kerning subtable (or lookup). (And presses [OK] in fontinfo).
----------------------------

revision 1.3355
date: 2010/04/23 02:40:24;  author: pfaedit;  state: Exp;  lines: +2 -2
Speed up approximating a spline given a bunch of on-curve points and slopes at the endpoints.
I have been trying for years to figure out how to apply least-squares to this problem. I kept having 4 equations and 2 unknowns. An over specified system with no solutions. I realized last night that I was looking at the problem wrong (of course). Instead of seperating it into x and y components and minimizing errors in each, I should have been minimizing the sum of the x and y errors. Simple. Worked first try. Makes stroking about 10-15 times faster.
----------------------------
revision 1.3354
date: 2010/04/23 02:17:03;  author: pfaedit;  state: Exp;  lines: +3 -3
When doing square pens or polygons then long bendy splines will be broken up roughly every 90 degrees (every time we switch verteces, actually). That turns out to be a good thing (makes it easier to approximate the curve). It doesn't happen automagically for circle pens, so add a little bit of code that detects 90 degree slope transitions and inserts a point there. Results are more accurate now.
----------------------------
revision 1.3353
date: 2010/04/22 00:57:25;  author: pfaedit;  state: Exp;  lines: +3 -3
Various optimizations to speed up stroking.
----------------------------

----------------------------
revision 1.3351

FF failed to put a trailing NUL on some strings for glyph classes resulting in strange displays (and complaints from pango about bad utf8 strings).
----------------------------

Add the ability to hide the kerning pane of the kern class dialog, thus allowing more room for data.
----------------------------
revision 1.3348
date: 2010/04/16 20:44:40;  author: pfaedit;  state: Exp;  lines: +2 -2
Some users don't like having the character representation of a glyph name showing up in lists of glyph names, so add a preference item: Prefs->Font Info->AddCharToNameList to let them turn that off.
----------------------------
revision 1.3347
date: 2010/04/16 20:24:04;  author: pfaedit;  state: Exp;  lines: +2 -2
If you have freetype rasterizing in the metrics view, and if you are working on a cubic layer, nd if you are editing a glyph in a char view and looking at it in the metrics view, and if you make a change to the glyph -- then Undo doesn't do what you expect. Instead the glyph gets autohinted (by default) before a font is generated for freetype, and a hint undo gets added to the undo list. Undo undoes the hint change (which the user probably isn't aware of) and leaves his/her changes untouched.
----------------------------
revision 1.3346
date: 2010/04/16 02:59:46;  author: pfaedit;  state: Exp;  lines: +2 -2

When doing Add Extrema on a spline where a control point was close to the base point (and pointed off so as to generate an invisible extremum very close to the base point, then ff's attempts to remove that extremum could cause the spline to become almost linear.
----------------------------
revision 1.3340
date: 2010/04/15 16:51:51;  author: pfaedit;  state: Exp;  lines: +2 -2
The default __iter__ for a selection type (in python) didn't work.
It was supposed to return all the selected encoding slots (that is, numbers) instead it returned the empty set (when I tested it, actually it's return would be random depending on an uninitialized variable).
----------------------------

When generating a cursive attachment anchor lookup fontforge did two passes through the glyph list. The first did everything needed. And the second thought it was handling marks (rather than cursives) and produced garbage.

When generating a feature file for a mark to mark lookup fontforge could generate gibberish.
----------------------------
revision 1.3333
date: 2010/04/14 23:46:39;  author: pfaedit;  state: Exp;  lines: +2 -2
Three bugs in reading feature files:
1) FF dereference garbage (and probably, but not necessarily) crash when parsing a glyph class with no glyphs in it inside an anchor specification.
2) When freeing data describing a list of anchors FF would crash if one of the anchors were defined to be NULL
3) A multiple substitution entry with just a single element in it looks exactly like a single substitution.  FF would complain about multiple substitution lookups containing both single and multiple entries.
----------------------------

Some time ago MS put in a patch to their OS so that they would refuse to load a font with a name table >5K. They have now decided that was an error
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/978909/
And have removed the limitation.

So remove the warning ff used to generate about name tables bigger than 5K.

Couple of patches from Louis Simard:
1) in the kern class dlg, if classes were very long then could segfault when displaying popup messages listing both first and second class members.
2) Would complain that the special case string "{Everything Else}" was a missing glyph.
3) Would crash when switching from a newly-created First class entry directly to the <New> entry at the bottom of the Second class column.

A new algorithm for stroking splines. Allows the user to specify arbetrary convex polygons as pens as well as more traditional circles (ellipses) and slanted rectangles (calligraphic pens).

Extended the python interface to allow for this.
Also added a new python function to the module: fontforge.unitShape(n) which returns a contour containing a regular n-gon.

When doing a Rename to Namelist operation prior to generating a font, FF neglected to clear the glyph-name hash table. This meant that any glyph lookups by name on renamed glyphs would fail. Meaning we would inexplicably lose substitutions.
----------------------------

When FF lists glyph names, it appends the unicode character of the glyph after the name. It probably should not do that if the glyph name maps to the private use area -- if the display font has a glyph there, it probably won't match the one in the designed font and will just add confusion.

Panov complains that the afii* names (and uni* or u*) don't mean much. So when we have a glyph name (or a list of glyph names) append the unicode character itself to the name inside parens. I don't do this everywhere yet, but moving in that direction. (don't do this for glyph names where it is obvious (like "A"), nor for names that might cause parsing confusion (like close paren itself or space)).

Dave Crossland tells me that some security patch to windows considers fonts with
 a 'name' table bigger than 5K to be insecure (Don't ask me why they think this)
 and windows will refuse to load any such fonts.
This means Windows won't load any font with the Open Font License in the 'name'
table.
This patch adds three checks:
 1) When generating a font it will let the user know if the name table is too bi
g.
 2) When loading a font in validation mode it will warn if the name table is too
 big.
 3) Font Info will make a rough approximation to the size of the name table (an
approximation which will always be too small) and warn if this approximation is bigger than 5K

Back in the dark ages adobe provide a set of encodings for the PUA. For instance A.small was encoded into PUA. Nowadays it is thought better to leave A.small unencoded. But if a modern font contained an A.small glyph FontForge would think it should be encoded into the PUA. So I added a preference item to turn off adobe's obsolete names.

Sadly the preference item wasn't very smart and turned off names like uE001 as well. Fix that.

Werner requests a command to check when a spline gets very close to the center of a pixel as this might be a candidate for a delta instruction.
That is: Grid fit many glyphs at many pixel sizes and see which splines come close to which pixel centers.
This is a functional but ugly implementation.

I think Barry wants to have different menu keybindings in different windows? That seems a really bad idea in general.

The cvs tree now contains a hack so that you can rebind the charview menus separately from the others.

If you have an entry like:
Â  msgid "CV*Open|Ctl+O"
Â  msgstr "Super+O"
then that will rebind Open in the charview and nowhere else.

Note that the string "CV*Open|Ctl+O" will not appear in the pot file, you must add it manually if you want to do this (that's because I don't want people to do this).

If you have a rebinding for
Â Â Â  msgid "Open|Ctl+O"
and no entry for "CV*Open|Ctl+O" (ie. the common case) then all menus (including the charview) will follow the rebinding.

Add a mechanism so user can specify a modifier mask to be applied to characters for navigation. Used to be that user typed "a" and the glyph for "a" was selected in the fontview (or the charview shifted to show "a"). No modifier was used. Now I've added "NavigationMask|None" to the pot file for hotkeys. If left as "None" then there will continue to be no modifier. If changed to something like "Super" then the super key must be used.

Panov suggests that for cubic points, when we round them we should not round the locations of the controls but should round the distance from the on-curve point.

Add support for reading/writing version 1.8 of Adobe's feature file format
(while, I hope, retaining the ability to read version 1.6). Fix a number
of bugs in parsing feature files.

FontForge now supports the 'BASE' table (in feature files).

The new format is considerably better than the old and can now be used to
express almost all of OpenType.

Changes:
  * ability to name anchors and value records and use them later.
  * contourpoints used to be expressed as "<contourpoint 2>" and are
      now expressed as "contourpoint 2" (no brokets). Adobe does not
      mention this in the changelog.
      [Incompatible change]
  * It is now possible to specify a GDEF mark attachment class in the
      lookupflags statement.
  * The syntax for mark to base/ligature/mark lookups is completely
      different.
      [Incompatible change]
  * The syntax for contextual lookups has been extended to allow them
      to reference lookups by name.
      [FontForge has always done this. When I suggested to Adobe that
       they follow suit they said they would not. They have now followed
       suit but have used an incompatible syntax to accomplish the same
       ends. So this is an
       Incompatible change
       for FontForge]
   * The syntax for contextual lookups has been extended to allow for
       the new mark lookups.
   * It is now possible to specify a reverse chaining substitution
       lookup.
   * It is now possible to specify descriptive names for the ss00-ss99
       features.
       FontForge doesn't support this but will parse and ignore it

There are some ambiguities in the spec, however
 * In section 4.d we are told that MarkAttachmentType/UseMarkFilteringSet
  both take <glyph class name>s, yet in 9.b we are told they take
  <mark class name>s
 * In 6.e a NULL anchor is defined by <anchorNULL>, shouldn't this be
  <anchor NULL>? In that same example the NULL anchor is not followed by
  a mark keyword and class, is this correct syntax?

There was a typo in UnitCloserToHV(), which resulted into a wrong unit

may depend from different "base" stems. Attempt to take care of this.

If a tt control point were on top of an on-curve point, then ff would ignore it. So when I read things in I moved it, slightly.

So only swallow control points if they don't have a nextcpindex.

In my eternal vigilence against rounding errors I failed to report some intersections which were very close to the end points.

Change the contour direction tester so that instead of looking at the first part of the contour it sees, make it check the whole thing, so if there are self-intersections we will get inconsistent results. Change everyone who looks at the direction tester to be prepared for an error return.

This makes no sense to me. But it does seem reasonable to want to specify the pixel size in the metrics view. And a zoom factor. So give people that option.

Distributions no longer provide .so files -- unless you ask for -dev packages, and sometimes those don't exist. This means that dlopening a library doesn't work.

Instead try to open the appropriate foo.so.? file if we can't find foo.so  (Not always, but in the more important cases).

Ok, perhaps cairo shouldn't be on for everything -- it does make stuff rather slow.
Cairo does two things:
  1) It gives us fuzzy splines
  2) It gives us fuzzy text
I want the fuzzy spline option in the outline glyph view (perhaps the bitmap glyph view which will also draw the outline).
I want fuzzy text everywhere. But fuzzy text is also done by pango. And if we use pango instead of cairo we get all the nice advanced typography stuff that pango does. So let's use pango.
(and cairo -- but just in the outline glyph view).

Alexej provides some new preferences for truetype hinting:
InstructDiagonalStems -- Generate instructions for diagonal stem hints
InstructSerifs        -- Try to detect serifs and other elements protruding from base stems and generate instructions for them.
InstructBallTerminals -- Generate instructions for ball terminals
InterpolateStrongPoints-- Interpolate between stem edges some important points, not affected by other instructions.
CounterControl        -- Make sure similar or equal counters remain the same in gridfitted outlines. Enabling this option may result in glyph advance widths being inconsistently scaled at some PPEMs

Ah. What cairo calls xor drawing operation, has nothing to do with the X11 xor drawing function (or ms windows xor, or anyone's else xor). So it didn't do what I wanted. The following patch should provide a mechanism which lets me do a real xor in spite of cairo.

more flexibe). I. e. if there are two or more equal or similar counters in the

counter control in the autoinstructor.

The previous patch for italic stems was incomplete, so a nan still could

Change the menu handler so it can draw mac menu icons (cloverleaf for command, up arrow for shift, ^ for control and weird squiggly for option).
Remove the hack that if the modifier mask for the command key was set then we'd also set the control mask (this meant that the command key would work as control, but it meant it could only work as control).
Let the command key work as itself, and put in special code so that if X11 is going to give us the command key (instead of using it in the X11 menubar) then we load a special set of keymap bindings (which, presumably, will use command). If we don't find a special set of keymaps, then fall back on normal processing.

I have been trying to attach marks to bases backwards. It is the mark which moves, so the attachment should happen when we get to the mark, and we should look backwards to find the base. I have been finding the base, and then walking forward to find the mark.

My approach fails if the lookup contains multiple subtables and a base glyph has two marks being attached, one from each subtable -- I would attach the mark in the first subtable, but then having found a subtable that worked would stop, and the second mark never got attached.

When pasting into a charview we only set the width if there was nothing in foreground. When pasting into the fontview we always set the width because we were clearing the foreground before we pasted (unless we did paste into -- then we didn't set the width).

With layers that should all change. We should only set the width if there is nothing in any of the potential foreground layers. Don't count the background layer or the grid psuedo layer. Don't count open contours (might be a secondary guide line layer or something). If we're going to clear a layer before pasting (normal behavior in fontview) then don't count the layer cleared.

  My intent was that ligature carets with positioned at 0 didn't count (0 isn't meaningful -- a ligature with a zero-width first component?) but that only got implemented for 'lcar' table not for 'GDEF'. So fix that.
  Also allow the user to specify exactly how many ligature carets s/he wants rather than just setting a minimum bound.
  Also 'lcar' output was broken.
  Also neither AAT nor OpenType supports negative lig carets, so if the user drags a lig caret line negative, have it stick at 0.

Change sfd.c so that it will treat the sequence "backslash newline" as no characters on input. And so that it thinks it can parse version 4 or the sfd format.

We don't generate version 4 yet, and we won't for a while. Version 4 will include the ability to insert backslash newline into long lines. This is so we can conform to the internet requirements of fewer than 990 bytes on a line. And the delay is so that people don't scream at me for making an incompatible change to the format -- if I give the parser time to perculate through the user community, with luck no one will even notice -- especially as long lines are rare.

Alexej would like to be able to manipulate non-unicode glyphs with the text field of the metrics view.  The textfield used to map all non-unicode code points to 0xfffd, but if the font doesn't make use of the supplementary private use areas (planes 15&16) then create a mapping from the font into these areas so that we can represent non-unicode glyphs as funky private use glyphs.

Make "-lang ff" work for "-lang=ff", it's more consistent with the rest of the arguments.

Add a -unique argument which means that FF checks to see if another fontforge is running on the current screen. If no other fontforge exists things proceed normally, but if there is another, then we send it our arguments and ask it to open them, and then we exit.

When deleting a layer from a font, ff very carefully went through all open glyph views to make sure none was looking at the layer being deleted (and fixing them up if they were) -- but it totally ignored the font views. Their layers needed to be updated too. And the metrics views too.

More work on conflicting stems. First attempt to collect information
about serifs, beaks, ball terminals and other features protruding from
their base stems and thus make some use of additional stems, found by
our stem detector but considered "too big" to be useful for PS hinting.

'nextedge', 'prevedge' and related fields are now arrays. Thus assotiating
more than one "next" ot "previous" opposite spline with the same point is
possible. Currently this is used only for better detection of ball terminals.

Got rid of the 'bothstem' property: no longer needed, as we can assotiate
any number of "next" or "previous" stems with the same point. 'bothedge'
is still preserved however.

If we had a spline which almost doubled back on itself, sufficiently so that the spline intersector found lots of really close points, which it called intersections, but not sufficiently so that our colinear detector caught it, then we'd generate a ton of intersections, overflow certain arrays, and trash the stack. => ff would crash. I didn't think this could happen, until someone provided a test case, so put in guards against this.

If we have a glyph named "agrave.sc" or "eacute.sc" then FF will now let you build this as an accented character. It will remove the suffix from then name, and look up the components of the bare glyph. Then for the first component it will search for a glyph named "a.sc" and insert it. For the accents it will use "grave.sc" if present, and "grave" if it is not.

Last month I put in a patch to make sure the lsb as stored in the 'hmtx' table was really the glyph's lsb if bit 1 of the head.flags field were set. Unfortunately I read in the lsb as an unsigned number which shifted negative lsbs off to around 65535. FF sometimes refused to rasterize them. Of course when the font was generated they got truncated back to negatives in the output.

Add a command Points->Make Arc, which is similar to Points->Make Line except that it connects the two points with an elliptical arc rather than a straight line. The ellipse is choosen to run through the two points (obviously) and to be tangent to the slope of those points. This isn't enough information to determine an ellipse uniquely (three points and two tangents being required) so in general there will be an infinite number of solutions (and it is possible to provide contradictory input so that no ellipse can be found). FontForge may not choose the ellipse you had your heart set on. FF will first attempt to find an ellipse so that one of the points lies on an axis of the ellipse (this will find a circle if there is a circle which satisfies the constraints above). If that fails it will look more generally for ellipses.

(If you hold down the <Alt> key when you select the menu item, FF will leave the ellipse it calculated in the background layer. That was a debugging technique but I thought it was kind of interesting and left it in.)

Further improvements in calculating active zones for curved segments : if the
spline is closer to the opposed stem edge at the given point, don't extend
the active zone any longer.

If a line's unit vector is close enough to the font's italic slant, then
prefer the unit vector based on the italic slant instead.

Added an experimental mode which allows to build glyph data based on
a preexisting hint layout and extend it with additional stems.

Add new python stuff to handle layers:
  fontforge.activeLayer()
    Returns the currently active layer
  font.layer_cnt
    Returns the number of layers in the font
  font.layers
    A dictionary like object which can be indexed either by an integer
    between 0 (inclusive) and layer_cnt (exclusive) or by the name of a
    layer. After indexing it returns a LayerInfo object. LayerInfo objects
    have no independant existance, and contain a layer's name and a boolean
    indicating whether the layer is_quadratic.
      font.layers[1].name = "Foreground"
      font.layers[0].is_quadratic = TRUE
    You may delete a layer
      del font.layers["Extra layer"]
    You may add a new layer
      font.layers.add("name",is_quadratic)
    (this object has an iterator which returns the names of all layers)
  glyph.layer_cnt
    Returns the number of layers in the glyph (this is the same as the
    number in the font, except for type3 fonts).
  glyph.layers
    Returns a dictionary like object which may be indexed by layer name or
    an integer [0,layer_cnt) as above. The result is a standard layer object.
    (this object has an iterator which returns the names of all layers)
  glyph.reflayers
    Returns a dictionary like object which may be indexed by layer name or
    an integer [0,layer_cnt) as above. The result is a standard list of
    references.
    (this object has an iterator which returns the names of all layers)
  layer.export
    It is now possible to export the contours of a layer (before only
    glyphs could be exported)
  glyph.export
    Slight change to the semantics. When outputting an outline file, there
    is now an optional second argument which specifies the layer to output.
    (again integer or layer name).
  font.generate
    Has a new keyword argument "layer" to specify which layer should be output.

If we have two fonts open, a type3 (multilayered) one and a normal outline, and we have outline glyph windows open from each font, and we move the focus between the glyph windows, then the layers palette will get left behind when focus moves to the other font.
(and other more complex senarios when switching between multilayered and outline).

When loading a feature file, ff would complain if a mark appeared in two anchor classes -- even if those classes were in separate lookups. This meant it got unhappy about a mark which was in both a mark 2 mark lookup and in a mark to base lookup.

I had intended not to give warning messages about names like "nine.oldstyle" (defined in Adobe's obsolete PUA mapping) when loading a tt font, if such a glyph had a different unicode mapping (or none) than the one Adobe used ages ago.
But I screwed up and was generating messages anyway.

When converting cubics to quadratics, if we had a curved spline where one of the endpoints of the spline had no control point, then we'd get a slope at that point of 0/0. This meant that we tried to put a quadratic control point on top of that endpoint which looked confusing and seemed unnecessary.

	in coordinates parallel to the spline and normal to it.
  4) Provide a "spline length" if the start and end points are on
	the same spline (instead of just if they were the end-points
	of the spline).

FontForge uses floats (which have ~24 bits of precision internally) to represent coordinates. Type2 fonts use a 16.16 fixed notation, which means that we only represent coordinates <256 accurately. This will cause slight errors during output and input of a font. Unfortunately, due to the rel-rel nature of postscript these slight errors accumulate.

So instead, when loading and saving a Type2 font use double precision temporaries. This should mean there will be no errors to accumulate. There will be slight errors when converted to SplinePoints, but these errors will not accumulate.

Barry points out that Scale To Em doesn't scale the guidelines.

Barry also complains that spiro points are rounded. This is more debatable. The bezier conversion will put bezier points where there were spiros, so if we don't round the spiros we get non-integral points. But if we do round the spiros we mess up the splines. Hmm.

It used to be that when a font had both 'mor[tx]' and 'GSUB' we would only read 'GSUB'. But Michel Boyer wanted to read both. So... read 'morx' after 'GSUB' and if we find a feature/setting that looks as though it corresponds to an existing OpenType lookup (which we can convert to a Mac format) then skip that feature/setting, presuming it to contain redundant data.

This is a finer grain approach, but similar to, the previous one. There we skipped the whole table, presuming it redundant. But in CharisSIL the morx table has a lot of functionality orthogonal to GSUB. So we must parse both.

Two related bugs that Charis SIL invokes:
1) This font has a contextual substitution which uses class 0 and replaces it via a nested lookup. But my feature file output could not handle class 0 (since it isn't really specified) and would crash.
2) However, in this case class 0 was specified by the coverage table (we fixed that earlier but just for kerning classes). So now fix for contextuals.

There is now an incomplete fontforge which uses the gtk toolkit.
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install
	$ make fontforgegtk
	$ make install_gtk

About all it can do is open a font and display it. If a menu command does not
require a dialog then it might work. There are probably scores of bugs even in
the little bit that supposedly does work.

The open dialog is extremely ugly. That's not my fault, that's gtk's widget.
The open dialog is far less functional than the one in the gdraw fontforge --
I can't figure out how to enhance it.

Adger points out that I should deal with long sequences of vowels or consonants. No word in Martin Chuzzlewith (Dickens) has more than 5 consontants in a row (postscript has 5). No word has more than 4 vowels. Other languages have different distributions, but the idea probably extends to all alphabets.
  There's also the problem of standard suffixes and prefixes (declensions, conjugations, superlatives). If I want it really to look like French I should add "er", "ir", "ez", "ant", ... to the end of lots of words. I could do that for French (and English) and could look it up for German and some others... but that's too much work and I've no idea if it is meaningful for Japanese...

Both Adobe Acrobat and Apple's Preview exhibit what I consider to be a bug. According to the PDF reference manual, if an Encoding dictionary is not specified for a font object then the built in encoding will be used. But both these programs reencode to AdobeStandard and do not use the font's built in encoding. GhostScript agrees with my interpretation and does not reencode.

However, they ain't gwana change, so I must. Always dump out an Encoding dictionary even when it shouldn't be needed.

* Lines are more actively used: stems now have 'leftline' and
  'rightline' properties, and for diagonal stems the stem unit
  vector is always set equal to the unit vector of the line
  corresponding to the left edge of the given stem;
* I no longer attempt to calculate "active" zones for bounding
  box hints (they usually don't correspond to any actual glyph
  features and thus look ugly). So now only edges of such hints
  (without any active zones) are displayed in the charview;
* diagonal stem detection improved (some checks were too strict
  and actually oriented to HV stems);
* the 'blue' property is now used not only for ghost hints, but
  also for regular horizontal stems. This may be useful if I ever
  implement an autoinstructor based directly on the stem detector;
* glyph data initialization has been separated from stem detection
  and put into a separate routine (a first step for unification
  of algorithms used to calculate stem active zones).

Rumors abound on the web tha Apple has deprecated "/rsrc" as a way of getting at the resource fork. I find nothing official from Apple about this, but the /var/log/system.log file on my machine confirms it.
Rumors also say that the new approach is to open "/..namedfork/rsrc" instead. That seems to work, and doesn't cause nasty warnings in my system log.
There are warnings on the web that this mechanism only works on HFS+ file systems. So I first try namedfork, and then later, if that fails, try the older rsrc.

Several bugs in my mark attachment routines. There was an assumption that only one mark could be attached to a base glyph per sub-table. This is wrong for mark to base, in that there can be several anchor classes per subtable. It is even worse for mark to ligature where there can be many marks per anchor class (one per ligature position).

Having done this make sure we don't use the same anchor point more than once.

Patch by Alexej Kryukov
* I no longer have separate l/lpotential and r/rpotential pairs
Â  of point data objects. Instead I use just 'l' and 'r' accompanied by
Â  boolean flags indicating their state as "potential". This greatly
Â  simplifies some tests and makes the code more readable.

* When I am adding a chunk based on a single point to an existing stem,
Â  I always mark the second point as "potential". Later this state can
Â  be changed if check based on the second point produces the same chunk,
Â  or at least doesn't produce another (conflicting) stem. Again, this
Â  simplifies some tests which accompany adding new chunks and makes the
Â  result of the stem detection less dependent from the order in which
Â  the points are processed.

* I allow assigning a point to a stem even when its distance from the
Â  stem edge is larger than standard dist_error_hv or dist_error_diag,
Â  if only the difference between maximum possible deviations to the
Â  both sides of the edge doesn't exceed the double dist_error_* value.
Â  This prevents us from adding several almost-coincident hints, actually
Â  controlling the same stem.

* I have added a function which performs some stem normalization,
Â  sorting chunks by point coordinates. For HV stems it also can
Â  slightly modify the positioning of the stem edges preferring the
Â  coordinate which is closer to most points assigned to each edge.

* There is now a special function used to compare conflicting stems
Â  and decide if one of these two should be preferred, or they both are
Â  worth to be output.

* The detection of serifs and similar elements, which, not being
Â  exactly horizontal/vertical, still have to be marked with a HV
Â  stem, has been improved (two points, forming a serif termination,
Â  now should not necessarily follow each other).

revision 1.2100
date: 2007/10/05 21:47:55;  author: pfaedit;  state: Exp;  lines: +2 -2
There are ttf files in existance where glyph names do not match unicode code points. Tons of fonts use ".notdef" for glyphs other than "GID=0". Other fonts use ASCII glyph names (space, exclam, numbersign,...) for glyphs in other scripts (Kedage-n.ttf does this).

In the case of Kedgage, the glyph containine the digit one was nameless, and there was another glyph named one. FontForge would rename the nameless glyph to be "one" also. Then there was a glyph named "r" with no unicode encoding -- FF used to give it unicode "r" even though it was not a latin glyph. Ug.

So because people refuse to do the right thing, I have removed the code which did the above and added code to complain about code point not matching glyph name.

Initial stab at importing Raph Levien's spiro into FontForge.

This code should allow people to import one of Raph's plate files (they seem to be rotated 180 (so they are upside down), but aside from that the import works.

Because Raph's code is GPL I've set up a separate directory ffspiro which has scripts to grab some of Raph's source files, add a couple of my files, mungle around a bit and produce a library to install.

This library has one entry point (currently) which will convert a set of spiro points (such as one might find in a plate file) into a set of cubic beziers.

Then there is code in fontforge's file import to read plate files, to load the library (if it exist) and do the conversion. Aside from the rotation problem it seems to work.

When the user renames a glyph then things dependant on it should change too.
So if any substitution (or pairwise positioning) refers to the old name, change it to refer to the new.
If any contextual change refers to the old name change to the new.
If any class of glyphs (kerning class, apple state machine, contextual by classes) refers to the old name change to the new.

More debateable: if we change "f" to "u0066" then change "f.sc" to "u0066.sc" and "f_f_l" to "u0066_u0066_l" (and recurse on those name changes).

date: 2007/08/30 15:39:28;  author: pfaedit;  state: Exp;  lines: +3 -3
Patch by Alexej to improved diagonal & curved stem hinting:
* If the algorithm is going to define a diagonal stem basing on
a point and that point has 'nextline' or 'prevline' properties filled,
then I use the line's vector (instead of that point's own vector)
for the new stem. This gives us more certainty that all points
positioned on the same line will be correctly detected.

* I think I have found a consistent method to calculate "active"
space for curved segments: instead of some "magic" manipulations with
control point coordinates, I use WalkSpline() with a larger allowed
offset. The advantage of this method is that the result depends
solely from the spline configuration (well, unless the spline
segment we are checking is too short), and thus it produces nealy
the same results for cubic and quadratic splines.

* I use more "liberal" checks for curved chunks, if both sides of
the stem are curved at the same direction.

* Probably the most noticeable change: I have moved ghost hint detection
to stemdb.c. There were 2 reasons for which I considered this necessary:
first, I wanted to use winding numbers to check if we are at the correct
side of the spline (the previous algorithm sometimes produced odd
effects due to the lack of this test), and second, it looks an
interesting idea for me to base the autoinstructor directly on the
stem detector output rather than on the PS hints layout. So it is
important that the stem detector now collects really all information
which may be of interest for the autoinstructor.

Patch from Alexej to auto hint diagonal stems:

* Some straight stems were incorrectly interpreted as curved.
* Asymmetric active zones were generated for symmetric features.
* Projections did not work well.
* SplineFigureOpticalSlope() could distort vertical/horizontal
Â  vectors, transforming them to slanted.
* StemIsActiveAt() could calculate a wrong winding number if there
Â  were more than one spline section close enough to the test position.
* Diagonal corner stems could be assigned to point data as next/previous
Â  stems, thus preventing the adjacent diagonal stem from being correctly
Â  detected.
* Diagonal corner stems with a flat outer side (stemcheat==3) could be
Â  considered "too big", if the flat segment was not long enough.
* FF failed to correctly figure out an active space for diagonal corner
Â  stems of the above (stemcheat==3) type if a stem had its "left" and
Â  "right" sides swapped.
* Some ratios and "magic" numbers have been adjusted. In particular
Â  the value of dist_error_diag was too small (in fact it may be too
Â  small even now).
* I had to rewrite GDFindMismatchedParallelStems() so that it takes
Â  into account not only stem width, but also the point positions
Â  relative to each other, since otherwise it sometimes could make
Â  a really bad choice.

In freetype 2.3.5 the binary layout of the execution context changed.
This means that if ff is compiled against a 2.3.4 library it can't debug truetype if linked with a 2.3.5 library (and vice versa).
So put in checks to see that the library version matches what we expect.

Also the contents of one of the structures has changed a bit, and a value that used to live in one field has moved to another (the ppem value moved from (exc)->size->metrics.x_ppem to (exc)->size->root.metrics.x_ppem.

Well, David warned me that this might happen.

Add minimal support for applying apple state machine lookups in metrics view.
Support is minimal because:
   Apple seems to figure line breaks before doing substitution process but
	I do it afterward so I don't know where the line breaks are and I
	can't enter either the line start or line end state.
   When I delete a glyph I delete it. Apple inserts a deleted glyph mark
	and then removes that later. State machines can respond to deleted
	glyphs, but I can't.
   I don't try to figure out which feature,settings should be on by default.
	So the user must pick them out manually.

The metricsview used the wrong count field to determine whether things changed. It used the glyph count, not the char count (which meant that when we had a ligature and the number of chars was greater than the number of glyphs, things got confused.)

Add two python methods:
  Layer.interpolateNewLayer(other-layer,amount)
  Font.createInterpolatedGlyph(glyph1,glyph2,amount)
The first creates a new layer by interpolating between the current layer and the layer in the first argument.
The second creates a new glyph in the font by interpolating between the first two arguments. The glyph's unicodecode point and name will be copied from the first argument (the font must not already contain this glyph).
If amount is 0 the result will look like the first glyph, if 1 then like the second.

If a glyph's point numbers weren't ordered properly (and that should not happen, but did), then when adding ttf instructions to the glyph, the instructions would be thrown out as soon as we noticed this problem.

If a glyph had no hints then ff could add a hintmask operator (which didn't try to control any hints). Now I can't find anything in the docs which SAYS it's illegal to have a hintmask in a glyph with no fonts, it does seem bad practice, and a program called tx.exe complained about it.

Patch by Michal Nowakowski to allow a nicer notation for delta instructions in the instruction editing window:
Example: PUSHB_3 6@12 8 1 DELTAP2

This moves point 8 by six delta-steps (that's clear) at 37 ppem (that's
not clear at first glance - assuming delta_base is 9, DELTAP2 works
from 25 ppem to 25+15 ppem, in this example it's 25+12 ppem).

So it's just a way of constructing an argument byte for DELTAP/C.

Werner doesn't like that I always add dummy bitmaps for .notdef, .null & nonmarkingreturn. It seemed logical to me that if I were prepared to add those glyphs to the outline font I should be prepared to add them to the bitmap strike. But Werner (I think) sees bitmap strikes as containing exceptional glyphs which need special handling, whereas I just saw them as complete fonts. So in this context I guess there is no need to add these glyphs.

As a compromise I have decided that I will add the glyphs to the bitmap strike if I added the glyphs to the outline font.

Oh. It is perfectly legal to have a context chain rule with no substitutions. This can be used to avoid matches in complex cases so:
[a-z] a b => does nothing
a b [a-z] => does nothing
a b => substitutes
will only substitute of "ab" is a word all to itself.

People asked me to implement the UFO/GLIF format in part because each glyph is stored in a separate file giving finer granularity to version control.
Personally I dislike the UFO format because there is no documentation on how to store GSUB/GPOS features (with the exception of kerning). No support for ligatures nor mark placement. No support for hints or truetype instructions. No support for cid keyed fonts. No support for multi-master fonts. No support for bitmaps. etc.
So I've tweaked my sfd format into an sfdir format: A directory containing separate files for each glyph.

Make libintl be another library we'll try to dlopen. This is complicated because on linux libintl is part of libc so there we must link directly.
Further complicated because fink install script has a bug and doesn't put /sw/lib in DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH so we have to look there ourselves.

The two preference items, AlwaysGenApple, and AlwaysGenOpenType, were a bad choice on my part and have lead to considerable confusion. I mentioned some time ago that I would remove them if there were no objection.

There was no objection.

I have now removed them.

I also made the SetPrefs scripting function sort of work if the user
tries to set one of these (it will set the appropriate flags in the
default option set used by generate).

The defaults of these flags were different on the Mac from everywhere
else. This meant that a script could do different things on the Mac and
on linux. That seems like a bad idea. I have changed things so that the
default options setting for generate is always OpenType.

THIS IS AN INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE AND SCRIPTS ON THE MAC COULD NOW BEHAVE
DIFFERENTLY.

When Adobe first released fonts with a 'size' feature they did not follow the opentype specification. In August of 2006 they announced an incompatible change to bring fonts produced after that date in line with the specification. Unfortunately there are programs which depend on the old, broken format.
   Legacy programs will not work when given a font in the correct format. New programs should be able to handle either correct or broken 'size' features.
  FontForge should now be able to read in a size feature in either format and gives the user the option of producing 'size' features in either format on output.

Once upon a time, Apple was so concerned about accuracy of floating point operations that they required all operations be performed in IEEE extended (80bit). This had the interesting side effect that a program which conformed to Apple's standards could not also conform to ANSI C (which required operations use double temporaries for double values). I find it somewhat ironic, therefore, that gcc on the mac doesn't even promote floats to doubles. FF needs the extra accuracy provided by a double (an extended type doesn't seem to provide additional assistance unfortunately). So on the mac we got extrema that weren't, which meant that remove overlap didn't.

Oops. There was a path through point info that called SplineRefigure3, so this meant that quadratic splines got converted to cubic ones (the font as a whole remained quadratic, just this one spline). It looked wrong.

After approximating a spline I used to check if it were close to linear, and if so, make it linear. Unfortunately that doesn't work too well when we are using elipse mode to stroke a path. The coordinate system gets all screwed up (by the ratio of the axes) and things look linear when they aren't.

Herbert Duerr from OpenOffice tells me that their OpenSymbol.ttf font when produced by fontforge does not work on Win98. This is because Win98 doesn't like the codepages bits ff produces and refuses to use any glyphs in the font. He submitted a patch to make ff produce a version 0 OS/2 table (with no codepage info) for this font. Win98 will accept it then. His patch was against an earlier version of ff and needed to be modified for the current version.

If the user has never called PrintSetup (or if the user has not called PrintSetup this session and has not loaded prefs), then fontforge will invode setpagedevice on a pagesize which will fit on either A4 or US-Letter. The PS manual says a printer should refuse such a size unless it has paper within 5 points of it. So on printers which follow the spec (not mine) nothing will print as it waits for paper.

Now if the pagesize has not been set, don't specify a PageSize to setpagedevice.

I have decided that I will now store all postscript strings in utf8 (copyright, weight, familyname, etc.) They SHOULD all be ascii. But the occasional copyright mark would sneak in. We went into an infinite loop on one such because that was an illegal utf8 string. So fix a number of problems related to this.

If a curved point had no control point in one direction, then ff thought it had no direction and felt free to change it. It should inherit the direction from the other side of the point.
This was even more confusing if the point went through a two step process, first simplifying one side into a line (losing the cp) then simplifying the line away (losing the direction).

Daniel Gillmor points out there is no way to set the OS/2 Width field from a script. He then provides a script which does this. I realize there is no way to set any of the OS/2 values (except panose) or the PS private dictionary, and there should be (and to retrieve them too).

the following new scripting functions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â SetOS2Value("item-name", value)
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GetOS2Value("item-name")
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â SetPrivateValue("item-key","item-value")
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GetPrivateValue("item-key")
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â HasPrivateValue("item-key")
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â RemovePrivateValue("item-key")

SetPrivateValue
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Changes (or Adds) an entry to the font's private dictionary with
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  the given key and given value. Both must be strings. The key may
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  be anything, it is not limited to any set of expected keys.
GetPrivateValue
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Returns the string in the private dictionary which matches the
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  given key. If the key isn't in the dictionary it explodes.
HasPrivateValue
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Returns whether a key is in the dictionary
RemovePrivateValue
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Removes a key (and associated value) from the dictionary.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Returns whether the key was in the dictionary (this is not a
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  typo).
SetOS2Value
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The first argument must be one of the following strings. The
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  second argument is usually an integer, but VendorId takes a (4
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  character) string, and panose takes a 10 element integer array.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Weight, Width, FSType, IBMFamily, VendorID, Panose,
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  WinAscent, WinAscentIsOffset
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  These are equivalent to the WinAscent field & []Offset
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  check box in Font Info->OS/2->Misc. Where
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  WinAscentOffset controls whether WinAscent is treated as
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  an absolute number or as relative to the expected
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  number.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  WinDescent, WinDescentIsOffset,
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  TypoAscent, TypoAscentIsOffset,
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  TypoDescent, TypoDescentIsOffset,
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  HHeadAscent, HHeadAscentIsOffset,
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  HHeadDescent, HHeadDescentIsOffset,
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  TypoLineGap, HHeadLineGap, VHeadLineGap,
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  SubXSize, SubYSize, SubXOffset, SubYOffset,
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Sets the Subscript x/y sizes/offsets
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  SupXSize, SupYSize, SupXOffset, SupYOffset,
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Sets the Superscript x/y sizes/offsets
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  StrikeOutSize, StrikeOutPos
GetOS2Value
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The argument takes the same set of tag strings. VendorId returns
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  a string, and Panose returns an array. The others return
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  integers.

Â Â  When ff pastes refs from one font to another it tries to figure out
	the width of a glyph containing references from the width of
	what appears to be the base glyph.
(because if you paste Aacute from one font to another, the size of the "A" glyph may be quite different in the new font. Using the width of the glyph in the original font would be wrong).

There are two problems with this:
	1) It didn't take forward references into account, and would use
		the original width rather than the modified width of the
		reference.
	2) It would (probably) be confused by an Alphatonos where the
		width of Alphatonos is not the same as that of Alpha.

instead figure widths out after all pastes have completed, looking at the use_my_metrics bit to get things right.

When ff generated a ttf/otf font with applemode set and opentype off then the font would have version 'true'. Which means windows would reject it. That's probably not a good idea given that this situation is default on the mac -- even if we don't have a GSUB/GPOS table we should at least let the glyphs show on windows.

Makers of fonts on the mac often use out of bound GIDs as flags in contextual substitutions. What I have seen is that one sub-table will insert such a "glyph" when a match is found, and then the next sub table will remove the flag, and perform subsequent transformations. This is important on the mac because there is a limited number of substitutions that can happen once a match is found, but if a match is found at the start (ie. the match being some magic marker glyph) then unlimited substitutions are available.
When ff first stumbled on these fonts it crashed, then it treated a gid>glyph_cnt as an error (and so it ignored the substitution). I've just put in code that creates dummy glyphs for all these bizarre GIDs so (I hope) the font will work after passing through ff (only there will be some real blank glyphs at the end of the font rather than vaper ware glyphs).

	Script/Lang list (as a string)
	Type (A string, one of Position,Pair,Substitution,AltSubs,MultSubs,Ligature)
The remaining entries depend on the Type
 For Positions
	a list of four numbers (dx,dy,d_hor_advance,d_vert_advance)
 For Pairs
	A string containing the name of the second glyph in the pair
	a list of eight numbers (dx,dy,dha,dva for first glyph, dx,dy,dha,dva for second glyph)
 For Substitutions
	A string containing the name of the glyph to be substituted
 For the others
	A set of glyph names (strings), one for glyph in the substitution.

FontForge was generating an incorrect warning message.
If a 'name' table contains a duplicate entry for a given platform/specific/language/id that's an error in the font. But ff conflated mac names with window names and so was only checking language/id. So if the mac windows names were different (which is probably a bad design idea, but not an error) ff said it was wrong.

It used to be that we didn't set the default background until the first font view window was opened. This meant that if we loaded a grey scale bitmap before opening a window (ie. from the command line) then that bitmap's clut would be relative to white rather than the appropriate background.

I realized a few months ago that there is a difference between encodings based on names and encoding based on unicode codepoints. Unfortunately I was only saving encodings as though they were based on names (generating default names if necessary). This patch retains the distinction even when encodings are saved to the preferences folder.

AddAccent behaved differently when passed a glyphname and a unicode code point. In the first case it used the glyph specified. In the second it performed an arcane search which would not always use the specified glyph (left over from the days when it was important to use a glyph in Adobe Standard so you could do a seac).

When interpolating to quadratic fonts where the two designs didn't match then the various possible errors gave us bad splines:
	Different numbers of points on the paths meant that the control points at the end (after we reached the end of the contour in one design but not the other) didn't match.
	Different designs meant that interpolating a line (with no control points) to a curved spline again produced nasties.

Peter Selinger has changed the way potrace is built so it no longer uses cygwin (it uses MinGW instead). This means that ff can't pass it the name of a temp file as "/tmp/foo" because "/tmp" is a cygwin concept.

David points out that the multi-resolution fonts are useless. Old palms can't used them and new palms are all high resolution. What is really wanted is two records, an old style low res font, and a new style (multi-res) font containing only high res images.

The replace with reference command only replaced the first instance found. In the case a few glyphs (elipsis, etc.) we need to replace multiple times.
(This was actually an intentional decision for the general replace command -- to avoid potential infinite loops -- but is an unneeded annoyance in this case).

The Options dlg (of Generate fonts) behaved oddly with respect to Apple mode & OpenType mode. This patch should make things clearer.
Also there was a typo and the setting for PS Glyph Name option was incorrectly controled by the truetype hints flag.

When given a glyph with conflicting hints where the first contour of that glyph needs no hints, then in type2 output the first hintmask operator would be omitted, which means that the location and width of the first vertical hint would be used as the position for the first point. This meant that the glyph would be oddly offset from where it should have been.

Oops. things are a little different than I guessed:
Sergey Malkin from MicroSoft tells me:
    Each shaping engine in Uniscribe can decide on its requirements for
    layout tables - some of them require both GSUB and GPOS, in some cases
    any table present is enough, or it can work without any table.

    Sometimes, purpose of the check is to determine if font is supporting
    particular script - if required tables are not there font is just
    rejected by this shaping engine. Sometimes, shaping engine can not just
    reject the font because there are fonts using older shaping technologies
    we still have to support, so it uses some logic when to fallback to
    legacy layout code.

    In your case this is Hebrew, where both tables are required to use
    OpenType processing. Arabic requires both tables too, Latin requires
    GSUB to execute GPOS. But in general, if you have both tables you should
    be safe with any script to get fully featured OpenType shaping.
So the script table of both needs to be the union of both.

Maxim Iorsh sent me a two fonts, one with a 'mark' table added by volt, one with a 'mark' sub-table added by fontforge. The ff font didn't work under Uniscribe. The two GPOS tables where essentially identical (same data, sub-tables in a
different order). But volt had also added a dummy GSUB table with an (empty) entry for 'hebr' script. If I removed the GSUB table, or changed the script in it to 'latn' the volt font did not work. If I added a GSUB table with a (dummy) hebrew substitution the ff font worked.
Conclusion: Uniscribe expects a script entry in GSUB for all scripts in GPOS. No one on the opentype list bothered to respond to my request for elucidation, so I stick with this conclusion for now.

revision 1.464

SplineOverlap gets very upset when it is given points that are very close but not quite at the same coordinate. Suddenly sounding errors become significant. Before I've done some implicit rounding, and that generally improves things, but it can make things worse (ie. round2int would move .4999 far from .5001 instead of
making them identical). So I've added a new command "Cluster" which looks for clusters of coordinate values, and forces them all to have the same coordinate.

If we have two glyphs, for example bullet and openbullet where the outer circle of openbullet matches the only circle of bullet, then that appears to be a match and ReplaceWithReference wants to replace it. But that would leave us with a reference and a counter-clockwise path... which makes no sense. So look for this very particular case, and don't allow it to happen. I don't see how to detect more complex cases without huge amounts of processing.

Still a few cases (the final spline of a contour) where curved splines came out as lines.
Improved the points window by
	* showing implied points
	* showing whether a point is on/off curve (normal/control)
	* added a scroll bar
Changed the default behavior of the points window to show normal (not twilight) points on start up.

Piska keeps complaining about the way ff handles 0 width strokes. He wants it to be a true 0 width, while PS says it means the thinnest possible line (not clear what that means in ff, I interpret it as a 1em-unit width). But this screws up the import of some METAPOST stuff which does a fill and a 0 width stroke, expecting the stroke to be 0 width. So if I have a fill and a 0 width stroke I turn off stroking. (But a stand-alone zero-width stroke, by itself, will still do a minimal stroke (1 em-unit)).

We were dumping all opentype ligatures into an ofm(tfm) file. Not a good idea. In almost all cases "No" should not become the numero glyph.
Omega seems to believe that 0 width glyphs don't exist. This means it thinks none of the combining accents exist. So we hack a zero width (on all real glyphs) to be the smallest positive width.

Daniel Gillmor points out there is no way to set the Weight field of the OS/2 table in a script. And provides a patch to make this possible. It made me realize there is no way to set any of the OS/2 fields (except panose) and extend his patch.

patch with the following new scripting functions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â SetOS2Value("item-name", value)
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GetOS2Value("item-name")
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â SetPrivateValue("item-key","item-value")
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GetPrivateValue("item-key")
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â HasPrivateValue("item-key")
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â RemovePrivateValue("item-key")

SetPrivateValue
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Changes (or Adds) an entry to the font's private dictionary with
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  the given key and given value. Both must be strings. The key may
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  be anything, it is not limited to any set of expected keys.
GetPrivateValue
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Returns the string in the private dictionary which matches the
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  given key. If the key isn't in the dictionary it explodes.
HasPrivateValue
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Returns whether a key is in the dictionary
RemovePrivateValue
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Removes a key (and associated value) from the dictionary.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Returns whether the key was in the dictionary (this is not a
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  typo).
SetOS2Value
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The first argument must be one of the following strings. The
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  second argument is usually an integer, but VendorId takes a (4
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  character) string, and panose takes a 10 element integer array.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Weight, Width, FSType, IBMFamily, VendorID, Panose,
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  WinAscent, WinAscentIsOffset
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  These are equivalent to the WinAscent field & []Offset
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  check box in Font Info->OS/2->Misc. Where
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  WinAscentOffset controls whether WinAscent is treated as
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  an absolute number or as relative to the expected
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  number.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  WinDescent, WinDescentIsOffset,
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  TypoAscent, TypoAscentIsOffset,
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  TypoDescent, TypoDescentIsOffset,
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  HHeadAscent, HHeadAscentIsOffset,
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  HHeadDescent, HHeadDescentIsOffset,
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  TypoLineGap, HHeadLineGap, VHeadLineGap,
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  SubXSize, SubYSize, SubXOffset, SubYOffset,
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Sets the Subscript x/y sizes/offsets
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  SupXSize, SupYSize, SupXOffset, SupYOffset,
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Sets the Superscript x/y sizes/offsets
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  StrikeOutSize, StrikeOutPos
GetOS2Value
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The argument takes the same set of tag strings. VendorId returns
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  a string, and Panose returns an array. The others return
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  integers.
