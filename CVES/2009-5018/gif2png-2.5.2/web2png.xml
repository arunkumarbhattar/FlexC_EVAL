<refsect1 id='description'><title>DESCRIPTION</title>
<para>Web2png is a front end for gif2png(1) that automatically converts
entire web page hierarchies from using GIFs to using PNGs.  It does
image conversion and patches IMG SRC references in web pages.</para>

<para>The arguments to <command>web2png</command> must be directories;
if none are given, the current directory is assumed.</para>

<para>In each directory, <command>web2png</command> tries to convert
every GIF to a PNG.  It leaves alone GIFs that have either multiple
images or transparency, because these will not display properly in all
current browsers.  It also does not reconvert GIFs that already have
corresponding PNGs (e.g. the same name except for the .gif file
extension).  The original GIFs are left in place.</para>

<para>Web2png tracks successful conversions.  It then looks at each HTML,
secure HTML, HTML inclusion, PHP page, JavaScript program or Cascading
Style Sheet under the argument directories (extensions html, shtml,
.inc, .php, .js, .css). In these pages, it fixes each reference to
each successful converted GIF to point at the PNG.  References in
relative HREF and BACKGROUND tags are recognized by filename and fixed
(any base directory declared by a BASE tag will be be prepended to the
relative URL).  References that are HTTP URLs are matched against the
list of convertible GIFs by basename; if there is such a match, the
contents of the URL is retrieved and compared to the convertible GIF.
If both basename and data match, the HTTP reference is fixed.
 
If the pages are under RCS version control, they're checked out for
modification before being altered; otherwise, a copy of the original
of each modified web page is left in the same directory, with the
additional extension .bak.</para>

<para>The following options change the behavior of the program:</para>

<variablelist remap='TP'>
<varlistentry>
<term>
  <option>-a</option>
</term>
<listitem>
<para>Convert all GIF files, including those with multiple images and/or
transparency.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
  <option>-d</option>

<listitem>
<para>Delete originals.  Removes all GIFs with corresponding PNGs, and all
.bak files.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
  <option>-n</option>
</term>
<listitem>
<para>Make no changes.  With this option, <command>web2png</command> reports on what needs to
be done (and on GIFs that use transparency or have multiple images),
but neither converts GIFs nor touches web pages.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
  <option>-r</option>
</term>
<listitem>
<para>Reverse.  Restore all HTML/SHTML/PHP pages from the .bak files created
by a previous run (or, if the files were under version control, revert
them).  Remove PNGs with corresponding GIFs.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
  <option>-t</option>
</term>
<listitem>
<para>Convert transparent GIFs (for use with IE 5.0+. Netscape 6.0+, and Mozilla).</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
  <option>-v</option>
</term>
<listitem>
<para>Verbose.  Utter more trace information about the conversion
process.  Web2png can be run on a directory that has already been
partly converted by previous runs; it will do the minimum necessary
amount of work.  The changes it makes will be fully reversible with
<option>-r</option> until you run it in <option>-d</option> mode.
Web2png is written in Python.  Python 1.5.2 or better must be
installed and accessible on your system in order for
<command>web2png</command> to run.</para>

<refsect1 id='note'><title>NOTE</title>
<para>Sometimes it's possible to convert transparent GIFs without altering
the appearance of the page, by knowing from context that they will
always place within an area of fixed and solid color.  Web2png can't 
deduce when this will be, so it doesn't try; but it may be useful 
to apply gif2png with the -b option by hand.</para>

</refsect1>

<refsect1 id='known_problems'><title>KNOWN PROBLEMS</title>
<para>The algorithm for fixing HTTP URLs is not foolproof. It could be
confused into incorrectly patching an HTTP URL reference to a GIF into
an invalid reference to a PNG if the GIF matches a local target GIF by
both basename and binary content, but actually lives on another host.</para>

<para>This program does not automatically convert CGIs; you'll have to do
that by hand.  Other dynamic-content methods (such as server-side
inclusions) may also require hand-hacking.</para>

<para>The program cannot tell converted from preexisting PNGs; if you have
PNGs with the same stem name as corresponding GIFs but carrying
different information, the <option>-r</option> mode will clobber them.</para>
